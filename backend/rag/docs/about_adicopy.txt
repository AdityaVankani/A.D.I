adi's projects:

1.DeToxify :
view link: https://github.com/AdityaVankani/DeToxify
Tech Stack: Python, NLP (Natural Language Processing), GCP, Docker, Vertex AI, Gemini API, Kaggle, BERT, BART-base
• Developed an NLP-based system to detect toxic comments using the BERT tokenizer for preprocessing and a BART-base model for classification. The
model was trained on a large-scale dataset sourced from Kaggle, achieving high accuracy in identifying toxicity with 0.98 AUC score.
• Designed an end-to-end GCP pipeline with Vertex AI for automated model training, evaluation, and deployment. Ensured portability and scalability by
packaging the entire solution into a Docker image (Python 3.9) for seamless integration across platforms.
• Integrated the Gemini API to rewrite and stabilize toxic comments into neutral, non-offensive language, providing a practical tool for managing online
toxicity in real-time applications.


2.TradeZone: Virtual Stock Market Platform 
View link: https://github.com/AdityaVankani/TradeZone
Tech Stack: React (TypeScript), Flask, Supabase, Material-UI, JWT
• Developed a virtual stock market platform with real-time trading, role-based authentication, and market control functionalities, designed for university
clubs and events with 100+ participants in stock market competitions.Implemented portfolio management, a market news system, and a leaderboard to
track top 10 traders, ensuring an interactive, data-driven trading experience with admin-controlled market dynamics updating every 30 seconds.


3.Product Recommendation System (Looksync)
View link: https://github.com/AdityaVankani/looksync
Tech Stack: Python, ResNet50, Streamlit, PyTorch, Scikit-learn
• Utilized ResNet-50 pre-trained on ImageNet for feature extraction from product images, generating embeddings stored in a .pkl file for efficient similarity
searches.
• Implemented cosine similarity matching with a 0.75 threshold using Scikit-learn, identifying the top 5 visually similar products for accurate recommenda-
tions. Developed an intuitive Streamlit-based interface for real-time image uploads and personalized product recommendations, optimized with PyTorch
for scalability and responsiveness.
